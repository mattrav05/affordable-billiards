    "content": "When choosing a pool table for your home, size is one of the most important factors to consider. The standard sizes are 7-foot (bar size), 8-foot (home size), and 9-foot (tournament size).\n\nFor most home game rooms, an 8-foot table provides the perfect balance of playability and space efficiency. However, you'll need to consider not just the table dimensions, but also the room space required for comfortable play.\n\nHere's what you need to know about room requirements:\n\n**7-Foot Tables:** Need a room at least 13' x 16'\n**8-Foot Tables:** Need a room at least 13.5' x 17'\n**9-Foot Tables:** Need a room at least 14' x 18'\n\nRemember, these measurements assume standard 58-inch cues. If your room is smaller, consider shorter cues or a smaller table size.\n\nAt Affordable Billiards, we help you measure your space and recommend the perfect table size for your home.

    "content": "Moving a pool table might seem straightforward, but it's one of the most complex furniture moves you can undertake. Here's why you should always use professional movers:\n\n**Proper Disassembly is Critical**\nPool tables must be completely disassembled for moving. The slate (which can weigh 200-800 pounds) must be removed carefully to avoid cracking. The legs, rails, and felt all require specific handling.\n\n**Specialized Equipment Required**\n- Dollies rated for slate weight\n- Proper lifting straps\n- Tools for precise reassembly\n- New felt (often needed after a move)\n\n**Precision Leveling**\nReassembly isn't just putting pieces back together. The table must be perfectly level - even 1/16th of an inch can affect play. Professional installers use precision levels and shimming techniques.\n\n**Common DIY Disasters We've Seen:**\n- Cracked slate (often unfixable)\n- Damaged table frames\n- Improper leveling causing poor play\n- Torn felt requiring replacement\n\nAt Affordable Billiards, we've moved hundreds of tables across Michigan. Our experienced team ensures your table arrives in perfect condition and plays like new.\n\nContact us for professional, insured pool table moving services!",

    "content": "Buying a used pool table can save you thousands, but knowing what to look for is crucial. Here's our professional buyer's guide:\n\n**Check the Slate**\nThe slate is the heart of any quality pool table. Look for:\n- Cracks or chips (deal breakers)\n- Proper thickness (3/4\" to 1\" for quality tables)\n- Level installation\n- Clean, smooth surface\n\n**Inspect the Frame**\n- Solid wood construction preferred\n- No loose joints or wobbling\n- Check for water damage or warping\n- Ensure leg attachment points are solid\n\n**Examine the Rails**\n- Rubber cushions should be responsive\n- No dead spots or excessive bouncing\n- Rails should be firmly attached\n- Look for worn or damaged rubber\n\n**Evaluate the Felt**\n- Even wear patterns are normal\n- Avoid tables with tears, burns, or stains\n- Remember: felt replacement costs $200-400\n\n**Test the Pockets**\n- Leather pockets age better than plastic\n- Check mounting hardware\n- Ensure proper ball return (if applicable)\n\n**Ask About History**\n- How long owned?\n- Reason for selling?\n- Any repairs or modifications?\n- Original purchase location?\n\n**Red Flags to Avoid:**\n- Unusually low prices (often damaged)\n- Sellers who won't allow inspection\n- Tables stored in damp basements\n- Modified or homemade tables\n\nAt Affordable Billiards, all our used tables are thoroughly inspected and refurbished as needed.
